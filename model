In batch and fed-batch processes, the rate of overproduction of heterogeneous proteins by
mammalian cells is limited by the decline in cell viability, by the depletion of required
metabolites and substrates or by the accumulation of metabolic products and inhibitors.
Differential equations have been the classic way of modeling cell culture of therapeutic
protein products within continuously stirred bioreactors. Product titer, cell densities and
viability and the concentration of major metabolites including glucose, lactate, glutamine and
ammonia can be easily predicted
The Monod-Kinetics mechanistic mathematical model for describing growth and metabolism in experiments
performed using the batch operation mode will be done using the 6 ODEs, 2 algebraic equations and parameters in the above
linked article.

Task 1: A GUI was created for user input. It was then assigned a class object for attribute references and
" if __name__ == '__main__' " used to import it to the main.py file so as to assign the user input to our
start variables.

Task 2: A function for the Monod-Kinetics model was then written and the graph comparisons between:
a) living and deadcell density against time
b) Glucose and Lactate conc. against time
c) Glutamine and Ammonia conc. against time

were plotted.
